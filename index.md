## Masks for Irvine

The covid-19 virus is rapidly spreading through our nation and our community. Just a month ago, it may have seemed that the virus was just a problem on the other side of the world, but now it is here and spreading quickly. We must act now to do all we can to stop its growth and plan for a future where we can resume life without fear of another outbreak. With this hope of getting back to a post-virus life, we should look towards effective methods of slowing the viral growth now and when we get resume life. This site is to argue for a community wide effort to outfit every person with a DIY homemade resuable mask and get people to wear a mask in public/work spaces. 

## How does wearing a mask help stop the spread of the covid-19?

Wearing a mask serves two purposes. A mask can reduce and potentially block the viral load that you inhale around another sick individual. The other purpose is to reduce the likelihood of you un-intentionally infecting others around you when you are asymtomatic. Both these purposes help to reduce the spread of the covid-19 virus. 

## Is wearing a homemade-mask effective?

Homemade-masks cab be effect at blocking micro particles. Homemade-masks are not as effective as n95 masks, but for the intended purpose of lowering the spread of covid-19 in our community it is still much better than not wearing one at all. In a 2008 research paper, [Professional and Home-Made Face Masks Reduce Exposure to Respiratory Infections among the General Population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/)  , published in the National Institute of Health, the researchers concluded that “..any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence.” Basically, we are much better off  wearing a mask in public.
