## Why Masks for Irvine?

COVID-19 is rapidly spreading through our nation and our community. Just a month ago, it may have seemed that the virus was just a problem on the other side of the world, but now it is here and spreading quickly. In Irvine, we already have over 33 cases. We must act now to do all we can to stop its growth and plan for a future where we can resume life without fear of another outbreak. Thus, we should look at other effective methods of slowing the viral growth now and when we end the shelter in place policy. One of the most promising methods is to get everyone in Irvine a mask to facial mask and to encourage wearing it in public spaces. Masks for Irvine is an effort to get community involvement in creating masks for all Irvine residence and getting everyone to wear one in public until COVID-19 is no longer a threat.

## How does wearing a mask help stop the spread of the COVID-19?

Wearing a mask serves two purposes. It can reduce and potentially block the viral load that you inhale around another sick individual. Wearing a mask also reduces the likelihood of you un-intentionally infecting others around you when you are asymptomatic. Both these purposes help to reduce the spread of the COVID-19. 
## Do we even need a mask if we are all sheltering in place?

The reality is that even with the shelter in place policy, people are still leaving their homes for valid reasons. Some work in essential services such as grocery stores, banks, and pharmacies. Others still need to go out to buy groceries, medicines, and other essential goods. Of course, if you can stay at home, then you should stay at home. If you need to leave your home and go in public, you should wear a mask to help slow the spread of COVID-19. 

## Shouldn't we reserve all masks for hospitals?

Yes, we should send those working in hospitals the equipment they need. We should send them our N95 masks and our surgical masks. We should give them these protective gear because they are ones most at danger of catching the disease servicing the sick. However, we can do more. We should be working on expanding the number of available masks in our community. If we can outfit each person with a mask and get them to wear it in public, we can reduce the rate of infection, which would help reduce the number of sick people visiting the hospital.  So, we should not send all the masks to the hospitals. We should send the more effective masks to hospitals and use the DIY masks ourselves.


## Is wearing a homemade-mask effective?

Yes, homemade-masks are effective at blocking microparticles and does help with lowering the chance of spreading and catching COVID-19. Although not as effective as N95 masks, homemade-masks are much better than not wearing one at all.  In a 2008 research paper, [Professional and Homemade Face Masks Reduce Exposure to Respiratory Infections among the General Population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/), published in the National Institute of Health, the researchers concluded that 

> ..any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence.s

Basically, we are much better off wearing a mask in public.

## How can I make one?

## What can we do to make it happen?

Let's follow the successful example of the Czech Republic. On March 18th, the Czech Republic passed a regulation requiring citizens to wear face masks in all workplaces, which includes all interior spaces. The nation of 10.6 million people, through community effort, got to 100% mask usage in 10 days, nearly through home DIY effort.  They were able to flatten the curve. Their current rate of infection is only 0.8 persons / million people, and the U.S is already at 5 persons / million people. So what can we do:

1. Start creating DIY masks for your family and friends.
2. Start creating DIY masks for other community members.
3. Wear a mask when you go in public. 
4. If you own a business, get masks for your employees and have them wear it.
5. Spread the word.
