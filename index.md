## Why Masks for Irvine?

The covid-19 virus is rapidly spreading through our nation and our community. Just a month ago, it may have seemed that the virus was just a problem on the other side of the world, but now it is here and spreading quickly. We must act now to do all we can to stop its growth and plan for a future where we can resume life without fear of another outbreak. With this hope of getting back to a post covid-19 life, we should look towards effective methods of slowing the viral growth now and when we resume life. This site is to look at getting community wide adoption of wearing masks in public spaces and a community effort to outfit every person with a DIY homemade resuable mask.

## Shouldn't all masks be reserved for hospitals and first responders?

Yes, we should send those working in hospitals the equipment they need. We should be sending them our N95 masks and our surgical masks. We should give them these protective gear because they are most at danger of catching the disease and we should protect the heros trying to save lives. However, we can do more. All of us can help create DIY masks to suppliment the total protective masks available. We can save the more effective masks for hospitals and pass the other masks to the public. 

## How does wearing a mask help stop the spread of the covid-19?

Wearing a mask serves two purposes. A mask can reduce and potentially block the viral load that you inhale around another sick individual. The other purpose is to reduce the likelihood of you un-intentionally infecting others around you when you are asymtomatic. Both these purposes help to reduce the spread of the covid-19 virus. 

## Is wearing a homemade-mask effective?

Homemade-masks can be effect at blocking micro particles. Homemade-masks are not as effective as n95 masks, but for the intended purpose of lowering the spread of covid-19 in our community it is still much better than not wearing one at all. In a 2008 research paper, [Professional and Home-Made Face Masks Reduce Exposure to Respiratory Infections among the General Population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/)  , published in the National Institute of Health, the researchers concluded that “..any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence.” Basically, we are much better off  wearing a mask in public.

## How can I make one?

Here are a few videos showing how to create a DIY masks.

## What can we do to make it happen?

Let’s follow the successful example of the Czech Republic. On March 18th, the Czech Republic passed regulation requiring citizens to wear face masks in all workplaces, which includes all interior spaces. The nation of 10.6 million people, through community effort, got to 100% mask usage in 10 days, nearly through home DIY effort.  They were able to flatten the curve. Their current rate of infection is only 0.8 persons / million people and the U.S is already at 5 persons / million people. So what can we do:

1. Start creating DIY masks for your family and friends.
2. Start creating DIY masks for other community members.
3. Wear a mask when you go in public. 
4. If you own a business, get masks for your employees and have them wear it.
5. Spread the word.
